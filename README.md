Code + Tutorials for the UW-Madison G575 Course (2013)

This repository includes the source and instructions for Labs #1 and #2 for the University of Wisconsin-Madison Geography 575 (Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization) course: http://www.geography.wisc.edu/courses/geog575/. 

Labs #1 and #2 make use of the open source Leaflet, jQuery, and jQueryUI libraries. The labs are written for a senior undergraduate / graduate student level and assume one introductory computer science prerequisite (not in JavaScript). The source code requires a web server to run correctly (e.g., http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html); source code can be tested locally in Firefox only.

Happy learning!
